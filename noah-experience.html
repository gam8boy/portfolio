                    This portfolio showcases my journey, reflections, and accomplishments during my on-the-job training (OJT) at NOAH Business Applications, while I pursued my bachelor's degree in computer technology. My OJT took place at NOAH Business Applications, a company celebrated for its cutting-edge Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions and its team of dedicated certified public accountants and information technology professionals. I was fortunate to be placed in the Financial V8 Department. I engaged in various BRTS (Business Requirements and Technical Specifications) projects and responsibilities, gaining invaluable hands-on experience and personal growth.

                    On-the-job training (OJT) is an important component of a college curriculum that gives students real, hands-on experience in their possible occupations. This type of training bridges the gap between theoretical information gained in the classroom and its practical application in work situations. OJT exposes students to a variety of work environments, allowing them to use their academic knowledge, learn applicable skills, and obtain practical insights that will be useful in their future professions.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    During my on-the-job training (OJT) at NOAH Business Applications, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in various aspects of the company's operations, focusing primarily on the development and testing of the Business Requirements and Technical Specifications (BRTS) modules. My training included both theoretical lessons and hands-on activities that allowed me to apply what I learned in real-world scenarios.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    At the beginning of each day, we started with a morning prayer, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among the team. My daily tasks were centered in the Financial Department, where I was responsible for preparing and testing various BRTS and BRSS modules. These modules are critical for ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of NOAH's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Every department has a designated trainer who is responsible for checking and monitoring our projects. The training also required close communication with my teammates and our department superior.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Throughout my training, I experienced many challenges and concerns, notably those linked to the range and complexity of BRTS preparations and tests. Despite these hurdles, with the help of my trainer and teammates, I was able to adapt and learn fast. This experience not only improved my technical abilities but also taught me important lessons about cooperation, problem-solving, and project management.

                    While pursuing my bachelor's degree in information technology, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at NOAH Business Applications. Being part of the development team marked the beginning of a journey rich with essential experiences and profound learning moments. Throughout my training, I engaged in hands-on encoding tasks and appreciated the value of working in a collaborative team environment. This experience not only enhanced my technical abilities but also improved my teamwork skills. I was grateful to work with NOAH's seasoned trainers and mentors, whose guidance, motivation, and unwavering support made my journey truly transformative.

                    I am delighted for the chance to intern at NOAH Business Applications, which provided me with real-world experience and taught me new skills and knowledge. Each assignment, project, and activity brought fresh obstacles that encouraged me to complete more tasks, practice coding, and broaden my grasp of software development principles. On the other hand, overcoming all challenges and problems, completing the assigned task within the deadlines, achieving the learning objectives, and having positive feedback gives me satisfaction and keeps me motivated to work more. This OJT experience gives me valuable opportunities to gain real-world experience, develop different skills, and prepare for my future career.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Reflecting on my experience with on-the-job training at NOAH Business Applications, I realize how transformational it has been for both my technical abilities and personal development. Working on real-world projects helped me use my academic knowledge in relevant ways while also uncovering new levels of creativity and problem-solving inside myself.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The experience has inspired me to try things beyond the familiar, embracing challenges with curiosity and amazement. The collaborative environment at NOAH promoted a feeling of belonging and purpose, and collaboration was necessary and inspiring. Experienced professionals provided important direction and encouragement, allowing me to navigate and overcome difficulties.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The challenges I faced, such as adapting to a dynamic workplace and tackling intricate projects, were met with resilience and a willingness to learn. These experiences taught me the importance of patience, empathy, and the power of a positive outlook. I learned that asking for help and leaning on others' strengths is not a sign of weakness, but a path to deeper connections and growth. As I move forward, I carry with me the lessons and experiences I gained from my internship, certain that they will prepare me for the challenges and possibilities that await. This journey has been a wonderful example of the power of constant learning, teamwork, and keeping true to one's principles.
